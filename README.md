# B.Sc. Thesis: Development-of-A-Low-Cost-Real-Time-Bioelectrical-Signal-Acquisition-Module
In this work, I presented the development of a portable and low-cost system for acquiring multiple bioelectrical signals including ECG, EMG, and EOG for advancing Human-Machine Interface (HMI) applications in healthcare. Using disposable skin surface electrodes and customized hardware, we detected the bio-electrical signals and further processed through Arduino Uno for Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC). A MATLAB Simulink model with low-pass filters optimized for specific bio-signals facilitated real-time visualization and data storage for analysis. The prototype demonstrated its effectiveness when tested on human subjects, showcasing potential integration into assistive technologies, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
